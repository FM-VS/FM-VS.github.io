This page contains more information related to out poster about the formalisation of planning and combinatorial optimisation in [Isabelle/HOL](https://isabelle.in.tum.de/).

See our websites for more information about us:
* [David Wang](https://david-wang.at/)
* [Thomas Ammer](https://toamme.github.io/)

We are supervised by [Mohammad Abdulaziz](https://mabdula.github.io/)

The [Isabelle Graph Library](https://github.com/mabdula/Isabelle-Graph-Library) contains formalisations of combinatorial optimisation theory and algorithms. The formalisation of flows is discussed in [A Formal Analysis of Capacity Scaling Algorithms for Minimum Cost Flows](https://drops.dagstuhl.de/entities/document/10.4230/LIPIcs.ITP.2024.3).

[FormPlan](https://formplan.github.io/) is about Isabelle formalisations of planning and model checking.
