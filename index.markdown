title: Formalising Mathematics to Obtain Verified AI and Optimisation Software

Thank you so much for your interest in our work! This page contains more information related to our poster about the formalisation of planning and combinatorial optimisation in [Isabelle/HOL](https://isabelle.in.tum.de/).

See our websites for more information about us and our work:
* [David Wang](https://david-wang.at/)
* [Thomas Ammer](https://toamme.github.io/)

We are supervised by [Mohammad Abdulaziz](https://mabdula.github.io/)

The [Isabelle Graph Library](https://github.com/mabdula/Isabelle-Graph-Library) contains formalisations of combinatorial optimisation theory and algorithms. The formalisation of flows is discussed in [A Formal Analysis of Capacity Scaling Algorithms for Minimum Cost Flows](https://drops.dagstuhl.de/entities/document/10.4230/LIPIcs.ITP.2024.3).

[FormPlan](https://formplan.github.io/) is about Isabelle formalisations of planning and model checking.

The references in our poster can be accessed [here](poster_references.pdf). The [poster itself](poster_itself.pdf). And [here](poster_full.pdf) are poster and references combined into one file.
